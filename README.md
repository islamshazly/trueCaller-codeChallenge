## Technologies
 - `RxSwift`
 - `RxCocoa`
 - `MVVM`
 - `Dependency injection`

## Architecture
Uses `RxSwift` and `observables` as binding mechanism between ViewController and ViewModel.
`MVVM` is ease of testing and ease of maintainability.
Bindings make UI updates easier to handle.
Use swift's higher order functions in soultion for fancy readable understandable code.

Unit testing covers service layer + ViewModel.
